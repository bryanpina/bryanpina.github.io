    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
    
    <h2> Short Introduction.</h2>
    
      <p> Hello! My name is Bryan Pina and in the following paragraphs you're going to get to know me a little bit.
        <br>First, the purpose of this webpage is for the current class I'm taking CSCI434 Web Programming. Back to a little bit about me.
        <br>I currently live in Japan with my wife and dog. We've lived here for almost two years and we love it so far! I'm originally from New York
        <br>and I plan on moving back to the states soon. </p>
      
      <p> I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and I need less then a year of school to complete my degree.
        <br>This is my first web development class and I am enjoying it so far. For this webpage I will be posting pictures
        <br> about my travels here in Japan for you guys to enjoy. One of my hobbies is photography, which I'm not very good at
        <br> So you guys will be able to see and judge my photography as well.</p>
