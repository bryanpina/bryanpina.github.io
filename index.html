    <h2> Short Introduction.</h2>
    
      <p> Hello! My name is Bryan Pina and in the following paragraphs you're going to get to know me a little bit.
        First, the purpose of this webpage is for the current class I'm taking CSCI434 Web Programming. Back to a little bit about me.
        I currently live in Japan with my wife and dog. We've lived here for almost two years and we love it so far! I'm originally from New York
        and I plan on moving back to the states soon. </p>
